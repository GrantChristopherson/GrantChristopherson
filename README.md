	Hello! I'm a full-stack software engineer based in San Francisco. In the realm of coding, I see parallels to my love for gardening: both require dedication, foresight, and a deep understanding of the environment. With proficiency in JavaScript, Python, and frameworks like Express and Flask, I've nurtured projects to be both robust and scalable.
	Away from the screen, my escape is my tropical shade garden. The parallels between the cycles in gardening and the iterative process in coding remind me of how interwoven the world around us is.  Making these connections is an inspiring reminder to constantly remain engaged with the world around us.  Both coding and gardening challenge me to think critically, adapt, and always be in pursuit of growth. This balance doesnâ€™t just recharge me; it seeds unique insights into my work, driving innovation. Ready to cultivate new ideas? Let's plant the seeds for your next project.
