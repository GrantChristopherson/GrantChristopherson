Hello, I’m a San Francisco-based full-stack software engineer with a passion for creating dynamic web applications.   I have experience working with JavaScript, Python, and frameworks like Express and Flask.   With skills in these technologies, I've created many robust and scalable projects.

When not coding, I can be found tending to my tropical shade garden or going to concerts happening around the Bay Area.   I find these hobbies are a great way to unwind and recharge my creative batteries.   I’m a firm believer that a well-rounded life helps me bring unique perspectives to my work, leading to more innovative solutions.  Reach out if interested in learning more about me!
